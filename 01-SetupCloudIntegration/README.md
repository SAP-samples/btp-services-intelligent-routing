# Introduction

In this step, you will setup two SAP Cloud Integration tenants in two different regions. 

**IMPORTANT: Therefore, two subaccounts in two different regions are necessary.** Not only will you subscribe to the SAP Integration Suite but further on provision the SAP Cloud Integration tenant and assign the needed roles to your user. 

## Setup SAP Cloud Integration 

1. If you haven't used SAP Business Technology Platform or SAP Cloud Integration yet, please go to the SAP Discovery Center Mission _[Get Started with Integration Suite - Cloud Integration](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3258/3327/?tab=projectboard)_

2. Go to your SAP BTP Cockpit and make sure that you have two subaccounts in your global account. In this case, we have both of them on GCP - one in Europe (Frankfurt EU30), one in US Central (IA US30). If you don't have them yet, click on **New Subaccount** in order to create a new subaccount.

    > NOTE: If you already have two subaccounts in regions where the [SAP Integration Suite is available](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/integration-suite?region=all&tab=service_plan), you don't necessarily need to create separate accounts for this tutorial. You can simply reuse the existing ones, if you want.

3. Provide the necessary details for the new subaccount. 

   - Provide a subaccount name. 
   - Optional: Provide a description. 
   - Select Provider **Google Cloud Platform**. 
   - Select Europe (Netherlands) or another region, where SAP Integration Suite is available. The [SAP Discovery Center](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/integration-suite?region=all&tab=service_plan) shows the available regions.  
   - Enter a Subdomain for your subaccount. This subdomain becomes part of the URL for accessing applications that you subscribe to from this subaccount.
   - Optional: If your subaccount is to be used for productive purposes, select the **Used for production** option.

4. Save your changes. 

**A new tile appears in the global account page with the subaccount details.**

5. Make sure that you have two subaccounts in regions where the SAP Integration Suite is available. If you don't have two subaccounts for SAP Integration Suite yet, create another subaccount as explained in Step 3-4. 

5. In the navigation area of the global account, choose **Entitlements > Entity Assignments** and select the subaccounts in which you want to set up SAP Integration Suite. Continue with **Go**.
